CPAccelerationTimer
===================

Calls a block a given number of times, spread out over a given duration, with the delays between calls – i.e. the acceleration/deceleration – determined by a given Bézier curve.

Think of it as an NSTimer with specifiable acceleration behavior.

Use cases
----------
- When you need an NSTimer with varying delays.
- When you need to synchronize behavior with a custom-timed CAAnimation.

Example “Accelerating and decelerating heartbeat”:
---------

	[[CPAccelerationTimer accelerationTimerWithTicks:10
			totalDuration:20.0
			controlPoint1:CGPointMake(0.7, 0.0) // ease in
			controlPoint2:CGPointMake(0.5, 1.0) // ease out
			atEachTickDo:^(NSUInteger tickIndex) {
				self.heart.transform = CGAffineTransformIdentity;
				[UIView animateWithDuration:0.3 animations:^{
					self.heart.transform = CGAffineTransformMakeScale(1.2, 1.2);
				}];
			} completion:^{
				self.heart.transform = CGAffineTransformIdentity;
		}]
	run];
